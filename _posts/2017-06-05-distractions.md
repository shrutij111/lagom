How does one really categorize actions and thoughts as being distractions? 

I have often felt that be it with our own selves, or with others close to us, we start identifying distractions when we need to hop onto our little land of personal retreat, at least a bit disjoint from our current state of existence.  We feel that the person in front of us is getting distracted when we ourselves are. This is when some space must be made, for ourselves.  

Be it just setting out on a short holiday, or getting immersed in a book, or even going through a listicle, experiencing those sudden and short sparks of enlightenment, just waking up to see the light starting to spread in the sky, or even writing out to traverse the diversified layers of a complex emotion, it is these small moments that we miss in our mundane mights and plights, which resurface in a bottled up form to remind us that whatever be our present companions- a research paper, a course text, a Youtube video, or the embodiment of our passionate love, are all different forms of distractions. Distractions from our calm, perfect and undistorted reality. Distractions that do not let us concentrate undividedly on what should have been our present occupation. Distractions that make us feel unproductive doing tasks that are meant to be forces of production. Distractions that make the clock not fast, but faint. Distractions that make us not realize connections as basic as the poetry of physics, and the physics of poetry. We perpetually sense that what we are doing is inadequate, and not in the shortest right direction.  

We are, but, skeptics of unthinking uniformity. Feelings of self-degradation begin to creep in when we begin to feel like belonging to our companions, rather than forming a whole with them. We begin to notice them as distractions, and sources of imbecility. We return back not to peaceful social equations unless quenched by rejuvenating fountains of self-exploration, individuality, and exquisite, creative extravagance. 

Twice I feel like I should let go, 
thrice I tell myself that this is not the right time, 
perhaps, Iâ€™ll find better avenues ahead,  
perhaps, it might be unnecessary after all, 
perhaps, you may only be an illusion,  
but, frice, I realize, what I actually perceive as you,  
is necessary to get away from you.

PS You is to represent distractions, personified.
