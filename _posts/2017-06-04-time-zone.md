China is two and half hours ahead of India, but it does not mean that India is slow, or that
China is faster than India. Both countries are running based on their own time zone.

Someone is still single. Someone has already changed five girl/boyfriends. 
Someone got married and 'waited' ten years before having a child, there is another who had had a baby within one year after marriage.

Someone graduated at the age of 22, yet waited 5 years before securing a job; 
and there is another who graduated at the age of 27 and secured employment just after national service.

Someone became a CEO at the age of 25 and died at the age of 50;
while another became a CEO at the age of 50 and lived to 90 years.

Evryone worked at their own pace. Everyone worked based on their time zone. 
That is, people can have things worked out only according to their pace. 
Some people have everything that works fast for them. Some do not.
Work in your time zone!

Colleagues, friends, associates, younger one(s) might "seem" to go ahead of you; some might "seem" behind you. 
Don't envy them or mock them, it's their time zone. 
Yours is coming soon. Hold on, be strong, and stay true to yourself. 
All things shall work together for your good. 

Youâ€™re not late, you're very much on time.
